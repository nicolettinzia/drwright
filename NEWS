Typing Break 2.91.0
===================

The Typing Break code has been removed from gnome-settings-daemon
and gnome-control-centre and is being ressurrected here as a
stand-alone module.

It consists of:
* the typing monitor itself
* a Gnome settings daemon plugin, to activate the typing monitor when enabled
* a Gnome control centre panel, to configure the typing monitor options

An attempt has been made to reuse the existing translations from g-s-d and g-c-c.
